# Retrieval-Mission
This is a playable simulation for landing an unmanned probe into an asteroid. The probe will be controlled remotely from the ISS to avoid exposing a human to possibly harmful situations.  The main purpose is to retrieve samples that might be of use to the scientific community, help understand the composition of asteroids and further the studies in this area.
